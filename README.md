# Totally Reliable Library aka TRL
This project was made to learn Data structures and Algorithms\
But also to have an In-House standard library. Don't really know if it will be used or not tho.

To build the library, look at [BUILD.md](BUILD.md)\
To setup the library, take a look at [SETUP.md](SETUP.md)\
To use the library, take a look at the "Docs" folder.
