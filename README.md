# Totally Reliable Library AKA ***TRL***

This is C standard library made by two people learning... *Things needed to make somthing like this.*\
But that doesn't matter because this is a "***Totally Reliable Library***" and you can ***DEFINITELY*** rely on it.

Jokes aside, this will be a good library. Atleat im hoping it will be because I wanna use it when or if I work on projects using C.\
The library has it's own Docs that update ever time a new Data Structure or Algorithm is created. And it has instructions on using it and/or building it.

To build the library, look at [BUILD.md](BUILD.md)\
To setup the library, take a look at [SETUP.md](SETUP.md)\
